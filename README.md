A Glimpse Into My World

My work is shaped by curiosity and systems thinking through STEM. I connect theory to practice by applying concepts from computer science, physics, and biology to real-world challenges.

I build, test, debug, and refactor programs to strengthen logical reasoning and automation skills. Physics informs how I analyze systems, constraints, and energy models, while biology sharpens my understanding of complex, interconnected processes—both of which influence my growing interest in quantum systems and computational modeling.


I document my progress on GitHub to track learning, identify errors, and continuously improve solutions through iteration.

Technical Focus & Workflow

• Languages: Python, JavaScript
• Core Skills: Algorithmic thinking, debugging, testing, automation, data handling
• Practices: Version control (Git/GitHub), iterative development, code documentation
• Approach: Build → Test → Debug → Refactor → Improve

I use GitHub to track progress, manage versions, and document technical decisions. Each project reflects an emphasis on learning through execution rather than theory alone.
