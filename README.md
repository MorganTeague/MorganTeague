# 👋 Hi, I’m Morgan Teague!

🌟 I’m a rising 12th-grade student at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School. With over 10 years of experience in STEM advocacy through **Black Girls CODE**, I’ve led app design challenges with NASA, served as a memeber of the Mikva Student Voice Council, and built a strong foundation in computer science and engineering. I’m passionate about sustainability, aerospace innovation, and creating equitable access to tech careers for underrepresented communities.
